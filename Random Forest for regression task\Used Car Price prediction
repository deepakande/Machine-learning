This project uses machine learning to predict numerical outcomes based on given input data.

Two regression models were implemented: Random Forest Regressor and K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor.

Random Forest is an ensemble algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and combines their results for better performance.

It helps reduce overfitting and increases accuracy by aggregating the results of different trees.

K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) predicts values by averaging the outputs of the closest data points in the training set.

Both models were trained using the training data and evaluated on test data.

The models were assessed using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and RÂ² Score.

These metrics help understand how well the model predicts and how far off it is from the actual values.

The goal is to find the model that performs best in predicting the target variable with minimum error.

This approach supports better data-driven decision-making by learning from historical patterns.
