Mobile Ads Purchase Prediction
In this project, we aim to predict whether a user will purchase a mobile advertisement based on various features. We used several machine learning models, including a Neural Network, Random Forest Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier, to make these predictions.

Prerequisites
Before you start, you'll need to have the following packages installed:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)

pandas

numpy

seaborn

matplotlib

scikit-learn

tensorflow

xgboost
You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow xgboost

Getting Started
Dataset:
The project uses the "mobile_ads.csv" dataset, which contains details about users and how they interact with mobile ads. These features include things like user demographics and behavior, which help us predict whether or not theyâ€™ll make a purchase.

Models Used:
Neural Network: A deep learning model that processes input data and makes predictions about mobile ad purchases.

Random Forest Classifier: This model combines multiple decision trees to make more accurate predictions.

XGBoost Classifier: A powerful machine learning algorithm known for its effectiveness in classification tasks, particularly when working with large datasets.

Results
After training and testing the models, we got the following accuracy rates:

Neural Network: 86.60% accuracy on the test set.

Random Forest Classifier: 87.50% accuracy on the test set.

XGBoost Classifier: 88.75% accuracy on the test set.

Conclusion
Out of all the models we tested, the XGBoost classifier performed the best, achieving the highest accuracy in predicting whether users will purchase mobile ads. This makes XGBoost the most reliable model for this task.

Feel free to dive into the code and modify it to suit your needs. The project is open for further exploration and experimentation!
