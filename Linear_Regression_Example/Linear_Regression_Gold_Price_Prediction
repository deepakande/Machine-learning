ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree & ðŸŒ² Random Forest
They can be used for both Classification and Regression.
But how they work internally changes depending on the type of problem:
When used for Regression:
Goal: Predict a continuous value (like price, temperature, etc.)

How it works:

The tree splits the data to minimize Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Each leaf node returns the average value of the target in that leaf.

Examples:

Predicting house prices

Predicting gold prices

Predicting temperature, sales, etc.
When used for Classification:
Goal: Predict a category/class (like spam/ham, yes/no, type A/B/C).

How it works:

The tree splits the data to increase purity (e.g., using Gini Index or Entropy).

Each leaf node returns the most common class among its samples.

Examples:

Email spam detection

Predicting churn (yes/no)

Disease classification (Healthy/Sick)
